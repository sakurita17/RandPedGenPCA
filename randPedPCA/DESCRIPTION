Description: Carry out principal component analysis (PCA) of very large pedigrees such as found
    in breeding populations! This package exploits sparse matrices and randomised
    linear algebra to deliver a gazillion-times speed-up compared to naive singular value decoposition (SVD)
    (and eigen decomposition).
